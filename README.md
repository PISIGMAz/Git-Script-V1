Create Repo.
First you must create a Repo but don't Add a Readme File.

How can i get Token?
If this is your first time using this, the most important thing is your GitHub Account Token. How can i get this?
Open your GitHub Account > Setting > Developer Settings > Personal Acces Tokens > Tokens ( Classic ) > Generate New Token ( Classic ) 
Select all options go down and Generate Token and Copy it. After 30 days you must change you Token.

How can i change Token?
Open your GitHub Account > Setting > Developer Settings > Personal Acces Tokens > Delete Token
After delete create new token, copy it, Open you File Manager go /home/UserName/documents/GitScriptLogs.txt remove old token and paste new one

How can i run this code?
First of all, Rust must be installed on your computer. How can i install Rust? See this link : https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
After installed open terminal and go the code you have Cloned and type this into the console : Cargo run
Now, code is running. Operations must be performed in the order specified in the console, otherwise code isn't run correctly.

How can I deal with this if I don't enter everything correctly?
Open you File Manager and go /home/UserName/documents/GitScriptLogs.txt and edit it.

Yes, I know, this code is the monument of unemployment :DDD
